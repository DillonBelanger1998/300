What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course? 

The problem being solved was having a softeware for a system that would help manage courses for students. Creating lists of courses and prerequisites for them as well as mantaining what courses students already had or will have in the future.

How did you approach the problem? Consider why data structures are important to understand.

I approached the problem by looking into what was needed for the students. What was their goal for the user of the software? I saw that what was needed was course information as well as a database for users (students) that would have their own specific information. Having data structures to store the course information for all the students was needed and became part of the solution. 

How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project?

When running into roadblocks throughout the project, I would overcome them by revisiting the issue that was present. For example with designing code for the data of the course information, I considered how much info was needed and the best way to sort and display it for students to have the most efficient access. Taking the time to really brainstorm and understand the problem I am trying to solve helped me get through difficulties that I would normally be stuck at wondering how I would go about designing any of the code. 

How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs?

The work on this project has really opened my eyes in the sense of having multiple strategies to achieve solving a problem. For example with the different data structures, all three could solve the task of having the data for the course and displaying them but having the perfect one for our case of the course information was the difference. Looking at the pros and cons of each and determining which was the best showed me how multiple approaches are possible and knowing the best one makes the end product even better.

How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?

I think it has improved how I go about writing my code more concisely, including more comments on my code to further explain my thought process. I think in terms of adaptability the thought process and considering different aproaches that I mentioned before has made my coding more adaptable as a result. I believe I can take different methods of coding be able to use the best one for the task needed.
